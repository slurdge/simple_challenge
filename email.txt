Please help me!

Hello,

I'm contacting you because I know you have programming skills. Recently, we uncovered an evil secret lab that is using a secret component and is planning to use it in an attack.

We infiltrated someone within the evil organization but she got caught. Before that, we could filter out the following program (attached).
We know it is a program that checks a password.

But nobody here understands it...

We also know that there is web page where you can get the secret component

https://secretserver/secretlab/

Our infiltrated agent confirmed that both passwords should be the same (python script and website).
Please, please help us finding the correct password and the name of secret component!

Sincerely yours,

The good guys
